# *Le Candela* : article creation tool

Small webapp to write articles and exporting them in html format. You can then use *CSS* stylesheets and *JS* scripts upon these html files to integrate them to a blog for instance. Currently written for french users, but will perhaps make an english version.

## Run

* Download the repository
* Open the *index.html* file (at the root of the repo) in your browser. So far, development is done using **Firefox**.

## Requirements

* HTTP server to use *javascript* modules ; I use **atom** with the extension [atom-live-server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server).

## Libraries

* FileSaver
* JQuery
